## Overview ##

**SiFit** is a tool for reconstructing phylogenetic tree from noisy mutation profile of single cells. Given an imperfect noisy genotype matrix from single cells, SiFit employs a heuristic search algorithm to infer the Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree under a finite-site model of evolution. Along with tree inference, error rates of the single-cell dataset can also be estimated.
